"The following hyperparameters were carefully selected and tuned for optimal performance:

• C = 1.0: Inverse regularization strength. Balanced overfitting vs underfitting.
• max_iter = 300: Ensured convergence without warnings.
• penalty = 'l2': Applied L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
• solver = 'liblinear': Efficient for smaller, binary classification datasets.

Grid search and trial-error were used during tuning based on validation results."
