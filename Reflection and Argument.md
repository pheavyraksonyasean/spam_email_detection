"Challenges encountered:

• The dataset was imbalanced (more ham than spam), which could bias the model.
• Outlier handling and proper preprocessing of text were crucial.
• Explored multiple models but chose Logistic Regression for its balance of simplicity and performance.

Reflected on improvements such as using SMOTE for class balancing and considering more advanced models like Naive Bayes or SVM.

The choice of evaluation metrics and thorough text preprocessing were key to reliable results."
